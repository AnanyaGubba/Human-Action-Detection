# Human Action Detection using Motion Sensor Data

# üìå 1. Project Description

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to detect and classify human actions based on time-series motion or sensor data, such as accelerometer or gyroscope readings. Such a system has practical applications in health monitoring, activity recognition, fitness tracking, and gesture-based control systems.

The notebook walks through preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using popular ML techniques

# üõ†Ô∏è 2. Tech Stack Used

# ‚ú® 3. Features
- Data Preprocessing
Cleans and transforms raw sensor/motion data for analysis and modeling.

- Model Training
Implements supervised learning algorithms such as:

  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

  - Random Forest

  - Logistic Regression (or others as included)

- Model Evaluation
Uses performance metrics such as:

  - Accuracy

  - Precision, Recall, F1-score

  - Confusion Matrix

- Data Visualization
Plots class distributions and feature correlations to uncover patterns.

- Prediction System
The trained model can classify a given input sequence into the correct human action.

# ‚öôÔ∏è 4. How It Works

1. Load and Explore the Dataset
Import motion sensor data and analyze distributions, balance, and structure.

2. Preprocess the Data

 - Handle missing values

 - Encode categorical labels

 - Normalize feature values

3. Feature Engineering
Extract meaningful statistical features if working with raw time-series sequences (e.g., mean, std, energy, etc.).

4. Model Training
Train one or more ML classifiers on the processed dataset using a training/testing split.

5. Evaluation
Predict on the test set and evaluate using various performance metrics.

6. Prediction
Use the trained model to classify new unseen motion sensor data into the correct human action label.
