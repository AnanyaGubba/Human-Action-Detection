# Human Action Detection using Motion Sensor Data
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to detect and classify human actions based on time-series motion or sensor data, such as accelerometer or gyroscope readings. Such a system has practical applications in health monitoring, activity recognition, fitness tracking, and gesture-based control systems.

The notebook walks through preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using popular ML techniques
